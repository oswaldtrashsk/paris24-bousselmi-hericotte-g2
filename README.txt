Hello sir, our project is a way to analyze gold prices, we used data from yahoo finance and most of the libraries seen in class. we thought about using a webdriver to go through trading views' website in order to have live prices, and managed to do so, but it would require a setup on your computer and it would be an additionnal inconvenience. 
the GoldAnalysis.py contains:
1. the gathering of gold, silver, SP500 and USD index but we wanted to focus the analysis on gold. 
2. the analysis of the prices through linear regression, correlation matrix and fibonnaci levels on periods from 1 week to  years.
